# Contributing to NRVS

We encourage contributions from individuals at all levels - students, postdocs, academics, software engineers, etc. Knowledge of the domain of signal processing, [NeurotechX Projects](https://github.com/NeuroTechX), Computational Neuroscience, and known tools for working with Neuroscience data such as [MNE](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html), [brainflow](https://brainflow.org/), are nice to have but not required.

We recommend that first-time contributors start by creating and resolving issues on existing active projects.

# Documentation

*Without proper documentation, our software is useful to the finite number of people who designed it. This fundamentally hinders the utility of software and makes documentation as essential as working code*

All projects MUST have a descriptive README.md file containing detailed information about the project, and its setup process. 
Please see the [NRVS-PROJECT-TEMPLATE](https://github.com/NRVS-Labs/NRVS-Project-Template) for an example of what the project README file should contain.

# Pull Requests

Briefly describe and explain the intent for the PR.

Please detail (where possible):
- what the update/change is
- reason for change
- what is affected by this change

# Issues

We encourage you to use software listed under our active projects and find ways they can be improved. Just like with PRs, when opening an issue make sure to describe with relevant detail the nature of the issue and the scope of the software that it affects.

# Community

We encourage you to communicate with other members of the NRVS community through our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/5E8QcZfa2Z). Alternatively we can be reached at nrvslabs@gmail.com.
